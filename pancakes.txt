Ingredients:
	250g flour
	4 eggs
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon sugar
	3dl milk
	2 tablespoons oil
	Butter for frying

Directions:
	1. Mix eggs with salt, sugar, milk and oil

	2. Carefully mix flour in to the other ingredients (use a strainer).
	   You might not want to use all the flour or maybe add some until
	   the thickness is as you like it.

	3. Mix until the texture is without clumps.

	4. Fry on pan in butter. You decide the thickness, mine are usually
	   quite thin (~2mm), other likes them thicker.
